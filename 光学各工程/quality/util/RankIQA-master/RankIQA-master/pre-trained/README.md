## The folder to put the pre-trained models for evaluation

1. [Rank_live.caffemodel](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1jIabZKU) is trained from Ranking dataset generated from 4 distortions (JPEG, JP2K, GB, GN), which can be a good initialization of your IQA algorithm. 
2. [FT_live.caffemodel](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1jIabZKU) is fine-tuned from one split of LIVE dataset.
3. [Rank_tid2013.caffemodel](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1jIabZKU) is trained from Ranking dataset generated from 17 distortions, which can be a good initialization of your IQA algorithm. 
4. [FT_tid2013.caffemodel](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1jIabZKU) is fine-tuned from one split of TID2013 dataset.

Apart from the above links, the models are also available on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1S55n7tHBfJop3Z-nDjHXvEc34HmHowZt?usp=sharing).
